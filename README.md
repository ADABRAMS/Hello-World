# Hello-World

My name is Andrew Abrams.  You can call me Andy!  I am attempting to edit the branched file and not the master file.  I hope it works!

I am a wescoe student, and have been using computers since around 1995 when my grandmother bought me an AST 486 with a whopping 4MB of memory.  

Lately, I've used computers mostly for streaming, playing games, and exploring the wild frontier that we call THE INTERNET. 

Just this past November, I built a PC all by myself for the first time.  I feel comfortable with the hardware side of things, but the software side of things has always been like looking at an alien language.  I'm hoping to get to learn about this language and hopefully get to a point where I can understand it!

Well, that should be enough for now.
